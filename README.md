Flight Reservation System: Automated Solution

Our project aims to address the challenges faced by the existing Flight Reservation System (FRS) by designing and implementing an improved automated system for flight reservations. The primary objectives are as follows:

Improved FRS Design: Our system overcomes existing issues, such as passengers' inability to select preferred seats, lack of boarding pass printing, flight cancellation or delay notifications, and limited access to aircraft maintenance reports.

Self-Booking Capability: Passengers can now effortlessly reserve flights through our user-friendly system, empowering them with the flexibility to manage their reservations independently.

Online & Counter Access: The system is versatile, allowing users to access it both online and at airline counters, ensuring a seamless and fully automated check-in process.

Problem Statement:

The current Flight Reservation System lacks essential features, leading to passenger inconvenience and inefficiencies in the booking process. Some challenges include seat selection limitations, absence of boarding pass printing, lack of flight updates, and no access to aircraft maintenance reports.
